# Electric Vehicles: An Update for 2025
[Mark's Blog](index.md)

Well, it’s official. I’ve gone from “the guy who bought an EV three years ago and had no idea what he was doing” to “the guy who evangelizes EVs all the time to friends, co-workers, neighbors, and anyone who will pay attention to him for more than five minutes.” If you’ve made it this far, congratulations - you’re the latest recruit!

Since I last wrote about EVs, we purchased a Hyundai Ioniq 5, so we are now a two-car all-EV household. The purpose of this essay is to give a lightning-fast (pun somewhat intended) review of the key concepts around EVs and provide some updated facts and recommendations.

## Key Concepts Reviewed
Our Ioniq 5 includes a display which shows us, for each trip, how many miles we traveled and how many kWh of energy we used (and, thus, the mileage per kWh). It also tells us how many kW of power are being delivered whenever the car is plugged in. Knowing these numbers has improved the way I calculate charging speed and range.

### Charging
There are three “levels” of EV charging:
* Level 1: This is your standard 120V wall outlet—the same one you’d use to charge a phone. It provides around 1.5 kW of power. It’s slow, but gets the job done.
* Level 2: This uses a 240V outlet, like the one you’d plug a dryer into, delivering about 7.5 kW of power.
* Level 3: Also known as DC fast charging, this is what you’ll find at public charging stations. These chargers provide 50–350 kW of power (150 kW is common). You won’t be installing one of these at home, but they are useful for road trips. Currently, Tesla’s NACS standard is distinct from everyone else’s CCS standard, but, with Tesla opening up its stations and more adapters becoming available, the industry is moving towards full interoperability.

You do not need an EV charging station at home to charge your EV, just the outlet. The charging stations are just a convenience.  Most long range batteries these days have 80kWh capacity, which means they can charge from empty (0%) to full (100%) in 80kWh / 7.5kW = 10.7 hours using a Level 2 charger. For our Ioniq 5, we do not charge our battery past 80% unless we have a big road trip coming up as that protects the battery’s longevity.

### Range
When it comes to EV range, the numbers can be a bit tricky. Most manufacturers advertise range under ideal conditions, where you might get 4 miles per kWh. In real life, though, it’s better to use a more conservative estimate.

I like to use 3 miles per kWh for everyday driving. So, for an EV with an 80 kWh battery, the "safe" range is about 240 miles. If you're driving in tougher conditions—think snowy roads, nighttime with the heater running, or long uphill stretches—you might want to plan for 2.5 miles per kWh, which would lower that range to around 200 miles.

The good news is that there are apps like A Better Route Planner that can help you plan your trips more precisely, factoring in terrain, weather, and even specific EV models. These tools take the guesswork out of road trips and ensure you’re never caught off guard.

### Cost
One of the biggest perks of driving an EV is the cost savings, especially when compared to gas-powered cars. The simplest way to think about it? Driving an EV is like paying $1 per gallon of gas. Here’s how the math works:
* At home, electricity typically costs around $0.10 per kWh.
* For $1 of electricity, you get 10 kWh of charge, which translates to about 30 miles of driving (using the conservative estimate of 3 miles per kWh).
* That’s roughly the same distance a gas-powered car gets on one gallon of gas, but for a fraction of the price.

Of course, the exact cost will depend on your local electricity rates and driving efficiency. But even in areas where electricity is pricier, EVs still tend to cost less per mile than their gas-powered counterparts.

## Should I buy an EV?
My answer is the same as it was two years ago: you probably should! But let’s break that down a bit more.

### Parking
The most important factor to consider is your parking situation. Specifically, can you consistently park near a wall outlet or within range of an extension cord? If the answer is “yes,” an EV is likely a great fit for you.

Why is parking so crucial? Charging your car overnight at home is by far the easiest and most cost-effective way to keep your EV powered up. It ensures you’re always starting the day with a full (or nearly full) battery and avoids the hassle of frequent trips to public chargers. For most single-family homeowners, this setup is straightforward.

Since adding the Ioniq 5 to our household, I’ve barely needed to use public chargers in 2024. Even on longer trips to places like Leavenworth or the Olympic Peninsula, the range has been more than sufficient, meaning I only charge at home. The convenience alone has been a game-changer.

If you don’t have reliable access to home charging, though, an EV might not be the best choice—at least, not yet. Public charging networks are improving, but they’re still not quite as convenient as pulling into a gas station.

### Grid
One question I often hear when talking about EVs is, “Does it make sense to drive an electric car if my local grid mostly uses coal or gas?” The short answer is: yes, it still makes sense!

Here’s why: Even on a grid powered entirely by fossil fuels, EVs are more efficient than gas-powered cars. This is because combustion at a power plant is significantly more efficient than combustion inside a car’s engine. Power plants operate at much larger scales and can optimize the process in ways a small internal combustion engine (ICE) simply can’t.

On top of that, electric motors are far more efficient than gas engines. EV engines convert about 90% of the energy they use into motion, while ICE engines manage only around 20% efficiency. This combination—more efficient power generation and more efficient motors—means EVs still produce fewer emissions, even when charged on a coal-heavy grid.

And, of course, grids are getting cleaner every year as renewable energy sources like wind and solar continue to expand. So, when you buy an EV, you’re essentially future-proofing your transportation: as the grid improves, your EV becomes even greener.

If you’re curious to dive deeper into the math and data behind this, check out studies on lifecycle analysis for EVs, which compare emissions from production, operation, and disposal for both EVs and gas cars. Spoiler: EVs come out ahead in nearly every scenario.

### Models
The EV market has grown significantly over the past few years, making it easier than ever to find a model that suits your needs.
Here are my top recommendations for 2025:

* Budget-Friendly: If you’re shopping for an entry-level EV, the Chevy Bolt is still one of the best options.
* Sedans & Hatchbacks: For something a bit sleeker, check out the Hyundai Ioniq 6 or the Ford Mustang Mach-E.
* SUVs: If you’re after a ride with more space, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 is an excellent choice.
* Trucks: For utility and power, the Ford F-150 Lightning delivers all the benefits of a traditional truck but with an electric drivetrain.

The biggest news for 2025? Three-row SUVs and electric minivans are finally hitting the market, offering even more choices for larger families or those who need extra space. Models like the Volkswagen ID Buzz, Kia EV9, and Hyundai Ioniq 9 are leading the charge in this category.

With so many options, EVs are no longer niche vehicles—they’re mainstream. Whether you’re looking for a commuter car, a weekend adventure vehicle, or something to haul the whole family, there’s likely an EV that fits your lifestyle.

### Tax Credit
If you’re thinking about buying an EV, here’s some good news: the EV Tax Credit is easier to claim than ever before.

In the past, you had to wait until you filed your taxes the following year to get your credit. But now, you can apply it directly at the time of purchase as a discount on the car’s price. This change makes the process more straightforward and ensures you benefit from the credit right away.

However, not all EVs qualify. For the latest information on which models qualify and any income restrictions, visit the IRS website or ask your dealership.

## Should I rent an EV when traveling?
If you’re traveling domestically, my answer is a resounding yes—consider renting an EV!

This is one of the biggest updates since my last essay. In 2024, whenever I needed to rent a car, I opted for an EV, and I’ve learned a lot from the experience. If you don’t own an EV at home, renting a Tesla is often the best choice for your trips.

Here’s why:

Public charging stations are still a bit of a mess. While the network is improving, I’ve found that you’ll often need multiple apps for different charging providers. Imagine if every gas station brand (like Shell, Chevron, or Exxon) had its own app for payment and station access—chaos, right?

Tesla bypasses this headache by having a robust network of Superchargers. Their system is seamless: you just plug in your car, and it automatically recognizes the charger, handles payment, and gets you back on the road quickly. It’s the simplest, most reliable option when renting an EV for travel.

The downside? Rental agencies tend to treat Teslas as premium vehicles, which means they’re usually priced higher. If you want a more affordable option, consider Turo, a peer-to-peer car rental service where you can often find better deals on EV rentals—no commission here, just a personal recommendation!

## Summary
When we bought our first EV 3.5 years ago, the market was still in its early stages. Fast forward to 2025, and EVs are now available for nearly every lifestyle and use case—even for rental when traveling. If your circumstances align, I highly recommend considering an EV for your next vehicle. The technology has matured, the options are abundant, and the benefits are clearer than ever!
